# [Global Azure Bootcamp 2015] (http://gwabmauritius.azurewebsites.net/)

In April of 2013 we held the first Global Windows Azure Bootcamp at more than 
90 locations around the globe! In March 2014 we topped that with 136 locations! 
This year we are again doing a one day deep dive class to help thousands of 
people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Azure. 
In addition to this great learning opportunity we will have another set of 
hands on labs.

## Open Source project

This project is one playground of the [Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community] (http://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/).
And the MSCC needs YOUR help! 

In preparation of the [#GlobalAzure] (https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GlobalAzure) event next year 
the community needs to have a local website for Mauritius. Any interested person 
can voluntarily contribute to that project here on GitHub.

### Status
The site is still in early stages and will be completed continuously. 
Show your skills, contribute to Open Source and make Mauritius known...
